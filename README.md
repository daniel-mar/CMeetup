# CMeetup
I love C# for the ability to reuse files/views, but it can limit how a website can look.

Login/Registration with a dashboard that allows people to create events or activities.
You are able to join events and when events expire they are unjoinable/removed from the board.

Like the other CRUD applications, in Python or MERN. There is error handling and validation for usernames/passwords.
C was bulky or clunky but is wonderful when given the time to pick it up.
